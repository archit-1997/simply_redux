# simply-redux

This application is a basic implementation of *redux* library along with *create-react-app* cli.

### It has two components :

#### Post component :
            This fetches a list of post from the [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)api which is                               a dummy rest api

#### Form component : 
            This is used to add a new post 


Redux has been used just so that we can share states between the two components i.e. adding a post to the form 
will update the list of the form data.
