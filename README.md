#simply-redux#

This application is a basic implementation of *redux* library along with *create-react-app* cli.

###It has two components :###

    * **Post component :** This fetches a list of post from the [*JSON Placeholder*](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) api which is actually a dummy rest api

    * **Form component :** This is used to add a new post 

Redux has been used just so that we can share states between the two components i.e. adding a post to the form 
will update the list of the form data.
